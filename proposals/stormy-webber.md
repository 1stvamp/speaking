## Abstract

An introductory talk to building fast non-blocking async web services with Tornado, especially relevant to Django, Flask, bottle, web.py, Pyramid, Zope, Gevent, Twisted and every other web (or not) dev interested in learning what makes Tornado special for such tasks.

Bonus: advanced tips and tricks for migrating from current systems and working with technologies such as WebSockets and Server Sent Events in Tornado.
