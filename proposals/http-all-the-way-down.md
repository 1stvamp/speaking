# It's HTTP, All The Way Down


## Abstract

As internal HTTP REST services, popularised by Amazon, have been gaining a lot of attention - newly emerging HTTP/1.1 extensions like Server Sent Messages and WebSockets are the perfect accompaniment to asynchronous tech stacks like Tornado, Twisted, Gevent and Node.js, not just for powering 10 minute chat demos.

Your stack is the web, it's HTTP, WebSockets, HEAD requests, RESTful, with Server Sent Events, and rich JavaScript frontends, it can be tested from a curl command in your terminal, it includes richmedia descriptors in tiny text headers on every request, and even a dumb shell script can put a realtime update to your browser.
Not only this you can even you track a single HTTP request from client to proxy, to backend service, to other backend service, to task queue, and back again to client.

It's Web Powered Turtles All The Way Down.
